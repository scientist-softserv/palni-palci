      # In OmniAuth, the options are a tenant wide configuration.  However, per
      # the client's controlled digitial lending (CDL) system, in the options we
      # use for authentication we must inclue the URL of the work that the
      # authenticating user wants to access.
      #
      # @note In testing, when the scope did not include the sample noted in the
      #       {#requested_work_url} method, the openid provider would return the
      #       status 200 (e.g. Success) and a body "Failed to get response from
      #       patron API"
      #
      # @return [Hash<Symbol,Object>]
      def options
        opts = super

        url = requested_work_url

        # WARNING! The order of the scope matters with the openid provider's implementation.
        #
        # Given the scope is `[:openid, url]`
        # When we provide the correct credentials to the openid provider
        # Then we get a "Failed to get response from patron API" on the openid provider
        #   and the hand shake process fails.
        #
        # Given the scope is `[url :openid]`
        # When we provide the correct credentials to the openid provider
        # Then we successfully complete the hand-shake
        #    and authorize the user into the Hyku instance.
        opts[:scope] = [url] + opts[:scope] if url.present? && !opts[:scope].include?(url)

      ##
      # Why all of the hoops?  Because in conventional Open ID the scope's are hard-coded.  However,
      # we're using the requested URL as the scope.  And that value is getting lost during the auth
      # hand-shake.  It's in one of the following 2 places.
      #
      # @return [String] The URL of the work that was requested by the
      #         authenticating user.
      #
      # @note {#session} method is `@env['rack.session']`
      # @note {#env} method is the hash representation of the Rack environment.
      # @note {#request} method is the {#env} as a Rack::Request object
      #
      # @note The following URL is known to be acceptable for the reshare.commons-archive.org tenant:
      #
