wg827ks1643,Image,Work in Progress - A Framework for Building Interactive Learning Modules,"The development of good quality educational software is expensive, time-consuming and faces some underlying issues. In order to deal with such issues, many attempts were made, mainly on code reuse. Following a similar approach, the development of an application framework for implementing a family of interactivity-intense educational software called Interactive Learning Modules – iLM is presented. The framework main goal is to reduce development efforts while being part of a Software Product Line – SPL, an innovative technique regarding interactivity-intense educational software. The framework specification is presented by analyzing the common features of existing iLM. Therefore, the resulting component architecture is outlined. Currently, the design phase is finished and the implementation ongoing. Also, its instantiation is planned for an existing iLM, as a proof of concept.", -- educational software, -- software product line, -- application framework,,,,text,"Dalmon, Danilo","Brandao, Leonidas","Brandao, Anarosa","Isotani, Seiji",,,,,,,,2011,4-20.png
